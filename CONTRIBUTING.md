## Reporting Issues

Before filing an issue:

3. **Check pull requests** for ongoing work that may address the issue.

## Submitting Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:
1. **Ensure the feature doesn’t already exist** in the codebase.
2. **Review existing pull requests** to ensure no one else is working on the same feature or fix.

    - **One pull request per feature**: If you want to contribute multiple changes, submit separate pull requests for each.
    - **Provide a coherent commit history**: Squash intermediate commits into meaningful ones.
    - **Document your changes**: Update the `README.md` or other relevant documentation to reflect your changes.
    - **Adhere to coding standards**: Use the PSR-12 coding standard.
